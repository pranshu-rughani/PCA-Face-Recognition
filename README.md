# PCA-Face-Recognition

1)This is just simple implementation of pca face recognition algorithm
2)Weights of each images and the test case  is calculated using PCA 
3)Images similiarity is measured using euclidean distance.

## Instruction to run code

1)address of all the .xml files and images must be editited.
2)all the images name must contaiin '16BIT_ _ _' in it's name where last three must be digit.
3)labels are given to image in name itself in above mentioned pattern.

## Result
1)Around 180 images where used for training and 20 for testing
2)86% accuracy was obtained
