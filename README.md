# PCA-Face-Recognition

-This is just simple implementation of pca face recognition algorithm
-Weights of each images and the test case  is calculated using PCA 
-Images similiarity is measured using euclidean distance.

## Instruction to run code

-address of all the .xml files and images must be editited.
-all the images name must contaiin '16BIT_ _ _' in it's name where last three must be digit.
-labels are given to image in name itself in above mentioned pattern.

## Result
-Around 180 images where used for training and 20 for testing
-86% accuracy was obtained
